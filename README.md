# Reddit Comment Analysis Bot

## What is it?

It's a bot that analyses the entire* comment history of a reddit user and replies with its findings.

\* - _Some comments may be unavailable due to how the reddit API works._

## Features:

* Analyses all the comments and posts made by the redditor.
* Finds the most commonly used words and creates a chart.
* Show a graph of user's most active subreddits.
* Displays some general information about the number of comments and posts.

**Note:**
Might not match the karma shown on profiles because for some reason it seems to be ignoring some older self posts. So I'm assuming that it does not consider self-post karma before the update that let selfposts give karma.

## To Do:
* Set up bot to run on Heroku/AWS

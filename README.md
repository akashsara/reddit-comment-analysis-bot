# Reddit Comment Analysis Bot

## What is it?

It's a bot that analyses the entire* comment history of a reddit user and replies with its findings.

## Features:

* Displays a list of comments of a redditor with negative karma.
* Displays a list of the highest rated comments.
* Analyses all the comments and posts made by the redditor and finds the frequency of words used and provides a chart.
* Breaks down total karma to karma gained from each subreddit and displays it as a table.
* Display the subreddit that the redditor has been most active on.
* Display the average karma that a redditor gets per comment and per post.

**Note:**
Might not match the karma shown on profiles because for some reason it seems to be ignoring some older self posts. So I'm assuming that it does not consider self-post karma before the update that let selfposts give karma.

## To Do:
* Set up bot on Heroku/AWS
* Set it up to comment a reply instead of printing to console
* Make sure it replies to each user only once
* Make a table to display karma breakdown
* Make a chart or bargraph or something for word frequency
* Display subreddits user is most active on
* Display average Karma/Comment
* Display average karma/Post
